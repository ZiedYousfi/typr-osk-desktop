# typr-osk-desktop

Typr is a cross-platform on-screen keyboard for accessibility designed to replace the built-in OS alternatives for a superior experience. It is highly customizable in both UI and UX to ensure it fits every user's specific needs because **that's the whole point of accessibility**.

This project was born out of frustration with existing solutions: the native macOS on-screen keyboard is notoriously buggy and unreliable, the Windows implementation is equally subpar, and there is a distinct lack of high-quality, accessible options for Wayland on Linux. Typr aims to provide a consistent, robust, and truly accessible tool regardless of the platform you are on.
